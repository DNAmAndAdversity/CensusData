## About the Data
- These data are derived from publicly available Census records and serve as variables relating to the racial composition, income distribution, and housing tenure of participants' residential census tracts and birthplaces from the My Body My Story (MBMS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Exam 5 cohorts.
- Data for the historical measures (racial composition and housing tenure at place of birth) from the 1940s, 50s, and 60s decennial Censuses were extracted by hand from online PDFs on the Census website.
- Data for the measures at participants' residential addresses were extracted from the American Community Survey using the `tidycensus` R package. R code is included for how the measures were extracted using Census variables.
- Several variables in the included data are based on the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (abbreviated: ICE). The formula sheets for the ICE measures are included in the file "ICE formulas sheet R_02_21_20.xlsx". See the following reference for additional details about use of the ICE in practice: Krieger N, Waterman PD, Spasojevic J, Li W, Maduro G, Van Wye G. Public Health Monitoring of Privilege and Deprivation With the Index of Concentration at the Extremes. Am J Public Health. 2016 Feb;106(2):256â€“63. (2023-05-05)
